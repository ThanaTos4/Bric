Bric

Bric is the codename for my course project design for EE-300 at Penn State. It is a portable digital audio player. It was evolved from my previous project RhythmPocketLite, and the code has been used as base for my next project called Fobu. The code hosted here is likely broken and won't compile and is only here for archive purposes.
